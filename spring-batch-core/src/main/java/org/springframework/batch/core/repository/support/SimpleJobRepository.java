     * <p>
     * Create a {@link JobExecution} based on the passed in {@link Job} and
     * {@link JobParameters}. However, unique identification of a job can only
     * come from the database, and therefore must come from JobDao by either
     * creating a new job instance or finding an existing one, which will ensure
     * that the id of the job instance is populated with the correct value.
     * </p>
     *
     * <p>
     * There are two ways in which the method determines if a job should be
     * created or an existing one should be returned. The first is
     * restartability. The {@link Job} restartable property will be checked
     * first. If it is false, a new job will be created, regardless of whether
     * or not one exists. If it is true, the {@link JobInstanceDao} will be
     * checked to determine if the job already exists, if it does, it's steps
     * will be populated (there must be at least 1) and a new
     * {@link JobExecution} will be returned. If no job instance is found, a new
     * one will be created.
     * </p>
     *
     * <p>
     * A check is made to see if any job executions are already running, and an
     * exception will be thrown if one is detected. To detect a running job
     * execution we use the {@link JobExecutionDao}:
     * <ol>
     * <li>First we find all jobs which match the given {@link JobParameters}
     * and job name</li>
     * <li>What happens then depends on how many existing job instances we
     * find:
     * <ul>
     * <li>If there are none, or the {@link Job} is marked restartable, then we
     * create a new {@link JobInstance}</li>
     * <li>If there is more than one and the {@link Job} is not marked as
     * restartable, it is an error. This could be caused by a job whose
     * restartable flag has changed to be more strict (true not false)
     * <em>after</em> it has been executed at least once.</li>
     * <li>If there is precisely one existing {@link JobInstance} then we check
     * the {@link JobExecution} instances for that job, and if any of them tells
     * us it is running (see {@link JobExecution#isRunning()}) then it is an
     * error.</li>
     * </ul>
     * </li>
     * </ol>
     * If this method is run in a transaction (as it normally would be) with
     * isolation level at {@link Isolation#REPEATABLE_READ} or better, then this
     * method should block if another transaction is already executing it (for
     * the same {@link JobParameters} and job name). The first transaction to
     * complete in this scenario obtains a valid {@link JobExecution}, and
     * others throw {@link JobExecutionAlreadyRunningException} (or timeout).
     * There are no such guarantees if the {@link JobInstanceDao} and
     * {@link JobExecutionDao} do not respect the transaction isolation levels
     * (e.g. if using a non-relational data-store, or if the platform does not
     * support the higher isolation levels).

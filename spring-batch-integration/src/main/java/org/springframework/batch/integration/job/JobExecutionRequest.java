/**
 * Encapsulation of a request to execute a job execution through a message flow
 * consisting of step handlers. A handler should pass the message on as it is,
 * modifying the request properties as necessary. Generally a handler will
 * execute a step as part of the {@link JobExecution} passed in, and should
 * change the status to {@link BatchStatus#COMPLETED} if the step is successful
 * (generally a handler cannot determine if the whole job execution is complete,
 * so this is just information about the step).<br/>
 * 
 * If the incoming status is {@link BatchStatus#FAILED},
 * {@link BatchStatus#STOPPED} or {@link BatchStatus#STOPPING} the request
 * should be ignored by handlers (passed on without modification).

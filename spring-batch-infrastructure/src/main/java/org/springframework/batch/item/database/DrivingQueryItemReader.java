/**
 * <p>
 * Convenience class for driving query item readers. Item readers of this type
 * use a 'driving query' to return back a list of keys. A key can be defined as
 * anything that can uniquely identify a record so that a more detailed record
 * can be retrieved for each object. This allows a much smaller footprint to be
 * stored in memory for processing. The following 'Customer' example table will
 * help illustrate this:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * CREATE TABLE CUSTOMER (
 *   ID BIGINT IDENTITY PRIMARY KEY,  
 *   NAME VARCHAR(45),
 *   CREDIT FLOAT
 * );
 * </pre>
 * 
 * <p>
 * A cursor based solution would simply open up a cursor over ID, NAME, and
 * CREDIT, and move it from one to the next. This can cause issues on databases
 * with pessimistic locking strategies. A 'driving query' approach would be to
 * return only the ID of the customer, then use a separate DAO to retrieve the
 * name and credit for each ID. This means that there will be a call to a
 * separate DAO for each call to {@link ItemReader#read()}.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Mutability: Because this base class cannot guarantee that the keys returned
 * by subclasses are immutable, care should be taken to not modify a key value.
 * Doing so would cause issues if a rollback occurs. For example, if a call to
 * read() is made, and the returned key is modified, a rollback will cause the
 * next call to read() to return the same object that was originally returned,
 * since there is no way to create a defensive copy, and re-querying the
 * database for all the keys would be too resource intensive.
 * </p>
 * 
 * The implementation is *not* thread-safe.

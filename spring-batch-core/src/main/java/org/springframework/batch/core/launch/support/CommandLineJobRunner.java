/**
 * <p>
 * Basic launcher for starting jobs from the command line. In general, it is
 * assumed that this launcher will primarily be used to start a job via a script
 * from an Enterprise Scheduler. Therefore, exit codes are mapped to integers so
 * that schedulers can use the returned values to determine the next course of
 * action. The returned values can also be useful to operations teams in
 * determining what should happen upon failure. For example, a returned code of
 * 5 might mean that some resource wasn't available and the job should be
 * restarted. However, a code of 10 might mean that something critical has
 * happened and the issue should be escalated.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * With any launch of a batch job within Spring Batch, a Spring context
 * containing the Job and the 'Execution Environment' has to be created. This
 * command line launcher can be used to load that context from a single
 * location. It can also load the job as well All dependencies of the launcher
 * will then be satisfied by autowiring by type from the combined application
 * context. Default values are provided for all fields except the
 * {@link JobLauncher} and {@link JobLocator}. Therefore, if autowiring fails
 * to set it (it should be noted that dependency checking is disabled because
 * most of the fields have default values and thus don't require dependencies to
 * be fulfilled via autowiring) then an exception will be thrown. It should also
 * be noted that even if an exception is thrown by this class, it will be mapped
 * to an integer and returned.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Notice a property is available to set the {@link SystemExiter}. This class
 * is used to exit from the main method, rather than calling System.exit()
 * directly. This is because unit testing a class the calls System.exit() is
 * impossible without kicking off the test within a new Jvm, which it is
 * possible to do, however it is a complex solution, much more so than
 * strategizing the exiter.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * The arguments to this class are roughly as follows:
 * </p>
 * 
 * <code>
 * java jobPath jobName jobLauncherPath jobParameters...
 * </code>
 * 
 * <p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>jobPath: the xml application context containing a {@link Job}
 * <li>jobName: the bean id of the job.
 * <li>jobLauncherPath: the xml application context containing a
 * {@link JobLauncher}
 * <li>jobParameters: 0 to many parameters that will be used to launch a job.
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * The combined application context must only contain one instance of a
 * {@link JobLauncher}. The job parameters passed in to the command line will
 * be converted to {@link Properties} by assuming that each individual element
 * is one parameter that is separated by an equals sign. For example,
 * "vendor.id=290232". Below is an example arguments list: "
 * 
 * <p>
 * <code>
 * java org.springframework.batch.execution.bootstrap.support.CommandLineJobRunner testJob.xml 
 * testJob schedule.date=2008/01/24 vendor.id=3902483920 
 * <code></p>
 * 
 * <p>Once arguments have been successfully parsed, autowiring will be used to set 
 * various dependencies.  The {@JobLauncher} for example, will be loaded this way.  If
 * none is contained in the bean factory (it searches by type) then a 
 * {@link BeanDefinitionStoreException} will be thrown.  The same exception will also
 * be thrown if there is more than one present.  Assuming the JobLauncher has been
 * set correctly, the jobName argument will be used to obtain an actual {@link Job}.
 * If a {@link JobLocator} has been set, then it will be used, if not the beanFactory
 * will be asked, using the jobName as the bean id.</p>
